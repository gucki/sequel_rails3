=About

This gem provides the railtie that allows sequel to hook into rails 3.x and thus behave like a rails framework component. Just like activerecord does in rails, sequel_rails3 uses the railtie API to hook into rails. The two are actually hooked into rails almost identically.

The code for this gem was inspired by sequel-rails and activerecord of rails.

==Contributing

If you'd like to contribute a feature or bugfix: Thanks! To make sure your
fix/feature has a high chance of being included, please read the following
guidelines:

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so we donâ€™t break anything in a future version unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
